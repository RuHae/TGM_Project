# TGM Report 2 Implementation 1

Topic #3: VAE-based Medical Image Generator

---

## Tasks

1. Implement solution 1 (put it on a GPU)
2. Extend Proof of Concept to a full prototype (like train on the a bigger training set, more epochs, try different parameters, ...)
3. Research variants of the VAE (e.g. $\beta$ VAE, CVAE, ...)

---

## Who did what

**Felix:**
- Creation of the boilerplate code for simple VAE in Pytorch (Proof of Concept)

**Zixuan:**
- Research about Pytorch/VAE
- Look into / investigate data package from MedMNIST

**Ruben:**
- Create Git
- Sample of VAE in tensorflow

---

## Problems

1. Only CPU version was really slow

---

## Solutions

1. Put the code on a GPU (local or Colab)

---

## Outlook

- Work on tasks 1 to 3
- Get more deeply into the variants of VAE

---

## Miscellaneous

N/A

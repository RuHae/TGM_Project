# TGM Report 1: Planning Phase

Topic #3: VAE-based Medical Image Generator

---

## Tasks

1. Create a Github repository for code / reports / etc. 

2. Template for reports

   1. Sections: Tasks, Who did what, Problems, Solutions, Outlook, Miscellaneous

3. Build a simple working architecture of a VAE

   1. We plan on building first a simple working model to later extend and work on the more advanced implementations of VAE (e.g. $\beta$ VAE, CVAE, ...)
